    <p>I always wanted to learn regarding programming. I love to read about technology, play with my kids. I am married I have 2 children and on on the way. I am currently working as a planning manager. I decided to start a new career as a way to keep learning.
    <p>What I like about BYU-Idaho is the flexibility to be able to study online. I have done webscrapping before so I hope that with what I am going to learn I could improve my skills about it.</p>
    <p>I have been a member all my live. I like the slogan President Kimball had in his desk. "Do it"</p>
    <p>I am an electronic engineer. I am currently serving as stake president and I am trying to be an example and study as I invite all the YSA to study,</p>
