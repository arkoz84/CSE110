        Star Trek was created by Gene Roddenberry. He was born on August 19th, 1921, in El Paso, Texas. He was a former pilot and police officer before he became a television writer. Roddenberry was inspired by various sources when he created Star Trek. He was influenced by C.S. Foresterâ€™s Horatio Hornblower series of novels, Jonathan Swiftâ€™s 1726 novel Gulliverâ€™s Travels, the 1956 film Forbidden Planet, and the television show Wagon Train. Roddenberryâ€™s vision for Star Trek was to create a science fiction series that would explore the human condition and tackle social issues of the time. He wanted to create a future where humanity had overcome its differences and worked together to explore the universe. Star Trek has since become a cultural phenomenon, inspiring generations of fans and creators alike
